# LM-TOAST
Code and data of the Findings of ACL 2023 paper "Making Pre-trained Language Models both Task-solvers and Self-calibrators"

# Installation

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir data
```



# Data Preparation

We use the same datasets and preprocessing scripts as in this [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00151)].
You can download the datasets from Google Drive [[download]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1738RctASgLd-vRIGxo4ytZFR3Kpb5nU0/view?usp=share_link "downlaod datasets from Google Drive"), 
and upload the folder (**TextClassification**) to the `data` directory. Then, all the datasets used in the paper can be find in ./datasets/TextClassification.
